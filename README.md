<h2>Installation</h2>
If you want to try it out:
<ol>
<li>Download the PlanetMiningGame1.1.zip and extract it</li>

</ol>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Start off by building a command center somewhere (Select it from the menu and press Q to build it).</p>
<p>Press D to dig a tile which can reveal various resources. Note: the deeper you dig the more energy it will use!</p>
<p>You can also trade your money for resources, this is important early on so that you can build mines on resources (which will generate that resource per turn)</p>
<p>Once you are out of energy and dont want to build anything new or trade for more resources, press Enter to end the turn.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to achieve 100 of all 3 influences types (which you can get by constructing buildings associated with each type).</p>
<h2>Noise</h2>
To randomly generate the terrain the game uses the perlin noise generator from the com.heresysoft.arsenal.utils package.
